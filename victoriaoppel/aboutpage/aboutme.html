                <h2>My Background</h2>
                <p>
                    I am Canadian-American with dual citizenship. I was born in Canada and lived in Montreal until moving to the U.S.
                    My family moved to California one week before my sixth birthday and we lived there until I was 11. I picked up tennis when I was 9 and 
                    stuck with that sport as long as I could. Due to surprising family circumstances, we moved two more times; back to Montreal for six months and finally, Florida.
                    We lived in a couple differtent cities in Florida. First gainesville for two years, and now we've been in Orlando since 2017.
                    Freshman year of college I lived in Tampa, but I am now permanently back in Orlando.

                <p>
                    To continue pursuing tennis at a high-level, I completed the first three years of high school online. Unfortunately, I suffered an L5 stress fracture in my lower back Sophomore year and retired
                     from the sport my Junior year.
                    I decided to finish high school in-person despite the uncertainty of COVID-19, and graduated from William R. Boone High School with a 4.5
                    GPA.

                    Freshman year of college, I attended the University of South Florida (USF) where I started a major in Computer Science. 
                    I thoroughly enjoyed my time at USF and met some of the most amazing people, but struggled a lot living on my own. It was a hard decision, 
                    but I realized that I needed to transfer to a college back home where I could focus on school rather than trying to financially support myself at 19. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will be attending the University of Central Florida starting fall of 2022 and am very excited for the new opportunities to come.

                <h4>My Interest in Computer Science</h4>
                <p>
                    I have been fascinated with technology since I was a child. I loved playing the kids video games my mom bought for my older sister and I.
                     I also tried using the family computer whenever there was a chance. When I got my first device (an ipod touch) at the age of 9, my curiosity for applications 
                     emerged. I wondered how they were made and if I could maybe learn to code one day and create something people would use on their devices.
